# BD Shop – Manual Testing Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves **manual testing of the Registration and Login modules** of the e-commerce application **BD Shop**. The goal was to validate functionality, usability, and reliability of the core user management features through a structured QA process.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure that **new users can successfully register** with valid data.
- Verify that **invalid inputs are correctly handled** with error messages.
- Validate the **Login functionality** with correct and incorrect credentials.
- Assess overall **usability, compatibility, and security checks** of user-related workflows.

## 🛠️ Scope of Testing
- **Modules Covered:** Registration, Login  
- **Features Tested:**
  - Form validation (mandatory fields, data types, boundary values)  
  - Input handling (alphabets, numbers, special characters, spaces)  
  - Checkbox and Captcha functionality  
  - Password validation rules (weak/strong, masking, matching)  
  - Browser compatibility and usability aspects  
  - Login workflow including Forgot Password and Remember Me
