#🛒 BD Shop – Manual Testing Project

<b>#Project Overview<b>
BD Shop is an **e-commerce web application** that allows users to register, log in, browse products, and perform transactions.  
This project focuses on **manual testing** of the **Registration and Login modules** to ensure functional correctness, input validation, and system reliability.  

The project was executed as part of a QA learning initiative to simulate **real-world software testing practices**.  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Validate functional requirements of **Registration** and **Login** modules.
- Identify defects in input validation and business logic.
- Maintain professional QA documentation (test cases, bug reports, summary, metrics).
- Provide execution evidence to stakeholders.

## 📂 Project Deliverables
The following QA artifacts are included in this repository:

- **Test Cases** – Detailed step-by-step test cases with expected vs actual results.
- **Bug Report** – Structured defect log with severity, priority, and screenshots.
- **Test Summary Report** – High-level execution results (Pass/Fail, defect trends).
- **Test Metrics** – Coverage analysis, defect density, pass percentage.
- **Traceability Matrix (RTM)** – Mapping between requirements and test cases (optional).
- **Screenshots & Proof** – Evidence of failed test executions.

## 🔍 Testing Approach
- **Type of Testing:** Manual Testing (Black Box)
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Equivalence Partitioning
  - Boundary Value Analysis
  - Negative Testing
  - Exploratory Testing
- **Tools Used:** MS Excel, Google Sheets, GitHub
- **Browsers Tested:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Environment:** Windows 10, Web Application

## 📊 Test Execution Summary
- **Total Test Cases:** 62

- ❌ **Failed:** 8  
- ⏸ **Blocked:** 0  
- **Pass Percentage:** 87%  


## 📌 Key Learnings & Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in **test case design and execution**.
- Practiced creating **bug reports with severity & priority classification**.
- Built professional QA artifacts aligned with **industry standards**.
- Strengthened knowledge of **manual testing methodologies** and defect life cycle.
